# Introduction of the app - Boggle Coding Challenge: 
Boggle is a word game that is played on a 4x4 board with 16 letter tiles. 
The goal is to find as many words as possible given a time constraint.  
For this exercise, we are making one modification.  Now it is possible for one or more of the letter tiles to be blank (denoted by *).  
When a tile is blank, it can be treated as any other letter.  

The program is deployed at: https://glitch.com/~boggle-game
